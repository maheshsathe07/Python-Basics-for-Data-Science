    "Q5. How are measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation used to describe\n",
    "the spread of a dataset? Provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- i. Range: It is a measure of dispersion, calculated by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value in a dataset. It provides an idea of the total spread but does not consider the distribution of values in between. For example, suppose you have a dataset of exam scores: {65, 70, 75, 80, 85}. The range would be 85 - 65 = 20, indicating that the scores vary by 20 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Variance: The variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It provides a more understanding of the spread by considering all values in the dataset. To calculate the variance, you take each data point, subtract the mean from it, square the result, and calculate the average of these squared deviations. For example, let's consider a dataset of ages: {25, 30, 35, 40, 45}. The mean is 35, and the variance can be calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance = [(25-35)² + (30-35)² + (35-35)² + (40-35)² + (45-35)²] / 5\n",
    "= [(-10)² + (-5)² + (0)² + (5)² + (10)²] / 5\n",
    "= [100 + 25 + 0 + 25 + 100] / 5\n",
    "= 250 / 5\n",
    "= 50\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the variance is 50, indicating the average squared deviation from the mean is 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of dispersion in the same units as the original data, making it easier to interpret. In the previous example, the standard deviation would be the square root of the variance, which is the square root of 50, approximately 7.07. So, the standard deviation indicates that the average deviation from the mean is around 7.07."

    "iii. A correlation of 0 indicates no linear relationship between the variables\n",
    "iv. A correlation of -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, where the variables move in opposite directions.\n",

    "\n",
    "ii. Correlation goes beyond covariance by providing a standardized measure of the relationship. It is extensively used in statistical analysis to assess the strength and direction of relationships between variables. Correlation is particularly valuable in analyzing large datasets, identifying associations between variables, feature selection in machine learning, determining the effectiveness of predictive models, and examining the strength of linear relationships in research studies.\n"

    "ii. Median: Outliers have less effect on the median. In the previous example, the median initially 25 and after adding outlier to dataset meadian becomes 30 i.e it is slightly increase.\n",
    "iii. Mode: Outliers do not directly impact the mode, as it represents the most frequent values. for example, in a dataset {10,12,10,13,10,12,1000}, before adding outlier to dataset mode is 10 and after adding outlier '1000' to dataset mode is again 10 i.e Outliers less effect on mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Measures of Dispersion:\n",

    "\n",
    "ii. Variance and Standard Deviation: Outliers can increase the variance and standard deviation, as these measures consider the deviation of each data point from the mean.
