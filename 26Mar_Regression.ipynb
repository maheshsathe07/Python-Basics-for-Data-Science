    "Q2. Discuss the assumptions of linear regression. How can you check whether these assumptions hold in\n",
    "a given dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "Here are the key assumptions of linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Linearity: The relationship between the independent variables (predictors) and the dependent variable (outcome) is linear.\n",
    "This assumes that the change in the outcome variable is directly proportional to the change in the predictor variables.\n",
    "You can check this assumption by plotting the predictor variables against the outcome variable and looking for a linear pattern.\n",
    "If the relationship appears curved or nonlinear, linear regression may not be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Independence: The observations in the dataset are independent of each other.\n",
    "Each data point should be unrelated and not influenced by other data points.\n",
    "Violation of this assumption can lead to biased and unreliable results.\n",
    "To assess independence, you can examine the data collection process and determine\n",
    "if there are any dependencies or patterns among the observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Homoscedasticity: Homoscedasticity assumes that the variance of the errors (residuals) is constant across all levels of the predictor variables.\n",
    "In other words, the spread of the residuals should be the same for different values of the predictors.\n",
    "You can check for homoscedasticity by plotting the residuals against the predicted values.\n",
    "If the spread of the residuals appears to change systematically with the predictors, heteroscedasticity may be present.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. Normality: The error terms (residuals) are normally distributed.\n",
    "This assumption implies that the distribution of the residuals follows a bell-shaped curve with a mean of zero.\n",
    "You can examine the distribution of the residuals using a histogram or a normal probability plot. \n",
    "If the residuals deviate significantly from normality, it may affect the validity of the regression results.\n",
    "\n",
    "v. No multicollinearity: There is no perfect multicollinearity among the predictor variables.\n",
    "Perfect multicollinearity occurs when one predictor variable can be perfectly predicted from a linear combination of other predictor variables.\n",
    "It hampers the model's ability to estimate the relationship between individual predictors and the outcome.\n",
    "You can assess multicollinearity by calculating the correlation matrix or using techniques like variance inflation factor (VIF).\n",
    "If high correlations or inflated VIF values are found, it suggests the presence of multicollinearity."

    "Q3. How do you interpret the slope and intercept in a linear regression model? Provide an example using\n",
    "a real-world scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-\n",
    "In a linear regression model, the slope and intercept are coefficients that describe the relationship between\n",
    "the predictor variable(s) and the outcome variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "i.  slope represents the change in the outcome variable associated with a one-unit increase in the predictor variable,\n",
    "assuming all other variables are held constant. It indicates the steepness or direction of the linear relationship.\n",
    "A positive slope means that as the predictor variable increases, the outcome variable also tends to increase,\n",
    "while a negative slope indicates a negative relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. The intercept represents the value of the outcome variable when all predictor variables are zero.\n",
    "It is the point where the regression line intersects the y-axis. The intercept provides the baseline value\n",
    "of the outcome variable when all predictors have no effect.\n",

    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Intercept: Let's say the intercept of the model is 50,000. It means that for a house with a size of 0 square feet, the predicted price would be $50,000.\n",
    "This intercept value represents the baseline price for houses that have no size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slope: Suppose the slope of the model is 100. It means that for every additional square foot in size,\n",
    "the predicted price of the house increases by 100, assuming all other factors remain constant.\n",
    "So, if a house has a size of 1,000 square feet, the predicted price would be $50,000 + (100 * 1,000) = $150,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpretation of the slope and intercept allows us to understand the relationship between the size of a house and its price.\n",
    "In this example, a positive slope indicates that larger houses tend to have higher prices,\n",
    "while the intercept represents the price of a house with zero size (an abstract concept in this context).\n",
    "These coefficients help us make predictions and gain insights into the impact of the predictor variable on the outcome variable."

    "\n",
    "Ans- Multicollinearity in multiple linear regression refers to a high correlation or linear relationship between two or more predictor variables. It occurs when the predictor variables are not independent and can reduce the reliability and interpretability of the regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. To detect multicollinearity, you can use the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Correlation matrix: Calculate the pairwise correlations between the predictor variables. High correlation coefficients (e.g., above 0.7) indicate potential multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Variance Inflation Factor (VIF): Calculate the VIF for each predictor variable. VIF measures how much the variance of an estimated coefficient is inflated due to multicollinearity. VIF values greater than 1 indicate multicollinearity, with higher values indicating more severe collinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. To address multicollinearity, you can consider the following strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Feature selection: Identify and remove redundant or highly correlated predictors. Select a subset of variables that are most relevant to the outcome while minimizing multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Data collection: Collect more data to reduce the impact of multicollinearity. Increasing the sample size can help in estimating the coefficients more accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Ridge regression or Lasso regression: These techniques introduce a penalty term to the regression model that shrinks the coefficients, reducing the impact of multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA can be used to transform the original predictor variables into a new set of uncorrelated variables, known as principal components. These components can then be used in the regression analysis, reducing the multicollinearity issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "v. Domain knowledge: Leverage subject matter expertise to understand the relationships between variables and identify potential collinearities. This can guide the selection or transformation of variables to mitigate multicollinearity."

    "Q7. Describe the polynomial regression model. How is it different from linear regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- Polynomial regression is a type of linear regression that allows for modeling nonlinear relationships between the predictor variable(s) and the outcome variable. While linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the variables, polynomial regression extends this by introducing polynomial terms of the predictors.\n",
    "The main difference between polynomial regression and linear regression lies in the inclusion of higher-degree polynomial terms (X², X³, ..., Xⁿ) in the model. These terms allow for capturing nonlinear patterns and fitting a curved relationship between the predictor and the outcome.\n",

    "Q8. What are the advantages and disadvantages of polynomial regression compared to linear regression? In what  situations would you prefer to use polynomial regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Polynomial regression can capture nonlinear patterns and fit curved relationships between the predictor and outcome variables. It allows for more flexible modeling of complex data patterns that cannot be captured by linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. By including higher-degree polynomial terms, polynomial regression can better fit the data and reduce the residual error compared to linear regression when there are nonlinear relationships present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Polynomial regression runs a higher risk of overfitting the data, especially when using a high degree of polynomial. Overfitting occurs when the model fits the noise in the data instead of the underlying pattern, resulting in poor generalization to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Polynomial regression introduces more complexity to the model due to the inclusion of higher-degree polynomial terms. This can make the interpretation of the coefficients more challenging and lead to a more complex model structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomial Regression is prefered in following situtaions:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. When there is a prior belief or evidence of a nonlinear relationship between the predictor and outcome variables, polynomial regression can be a suitable choice. It allows for a more accurate representation of the underlying pattern and captures the curvature in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. When a linear regression model fails to adequately fit the data, and there are indications of a curved or nonlinear relationship, polynomial regression can be employed to improve the model's fit and capture the complexities in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. In situations where the dataset is small, polynomial regression may be preferred over more complex nonlinear models. Polynomial regression provides a relatively simple yet flexible approach to model nonlinear relationships, which can be beneficial when limited data is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. If there is domain knowledge or theoretical justification for the inclusion of polynomial terms, such as in physics or engineering applications, polynomial regression can be a suitable choice to reflect the expected nonlinear relationships between variables."
